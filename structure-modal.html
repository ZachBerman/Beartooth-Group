                                    <p>According to the U.S. Office of Ecosystem Services, the U.S. is losing nearly ten square miles of land to development each day. Roughly two of these ten square miles are farms and ranches. This conversion brings people, roads, traffic, fences and energy consumption. We remove damaged, dangerous and uninhabitable structures and other wildlife un-friendly obstacles. We remove and/or remediate the structures, remove fencing and use wildlife-friendly fencing. We use conservation easements and other tools to permanently protect land. Through this work, including the protection of over twenty square miles of ranch land, we have seen the return of elk and other wildlife to areas they had not been able to reach for decades.</p>
